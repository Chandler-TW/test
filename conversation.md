## Title: Game On! Mastering C++ Lists and Vectors through Playful Programming

## Description:

Ready to transform data structures into exciting adventures? This training module gets you coding with vectors and lists in C++ while building fun, interactive programs. We'll ditch the dry tutorials and dive into creating engaging activities that solidify your understanding of these essential data structures.

## Learning Objectives:

* Implement vectors and lists in C++ for practical applications.
* Apply data structures to create interactive user experiences.
* Enhance your C++ programming skills through playful exercises.
* Grasp the core functionalities of vectors and lists through hands-on practice.

## Follow Me:

Before we begin, ensure you have a basic understanding of C++ syntax and variables. Familiarity with loops and conditional statements will be beneficial. Let's jump into the fun part!

## Practice 1-4:

Each practice session will guide you through building a mini-game using C++ vectors and lists. 

### Practice 1: Guessing Game

**5.1 Business Requirements:**

Develop a program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.

**5.2 Tech Requirements:**

Use a vector to store a list of past guesses for the user to reference.

**5.3 Learning Materials:**

* C++ random number generation: [Search online "C++ generate random number"]
* Vector functionalities: [Search online "C++ vector documentation"]

**5.4 Testing:**

Test the program with various guess ranges and ensure the random number generation and guess tracking work correctly.

**5.5 Sample Implementation:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  srand(time(0)); // Seed random number generator
  int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1; // Generate random number (1-100)
  int guess, tries = 0;
  vector<int> guesses;

  cout << "Guess a number between 1 and 100 (you have 5 tries): ";
  while (tries < 5) {
    cin >> guess;
    guesses.push_back(guess);
    tries++;

    if (guess == secretNumber) {
      cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the number in " << tries << " tries." << endl;
      break;
    } else if (guess < secretNumber) {
      cout << "Too low. Try again." << endl;
    } else {
      cout << "Too high. Try again." << endl;
    }
  }

  if (tries == 5) {
    cout << "Sorry, you ran out of guesses. The number was: " << secretNumber << endl;
  }

  cout << "Your guesses were: ";
  for (int guess : guesses) {
    cout << guess << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**5.6 Key Takeaways:**

* Utilize vectors to store user data (past guesses) effectively.
* Employ loops for user interaction and result comparison.

**5.7 Further Reading:**

* Explore more advanced vector functionalities like sorting and searching.

### Practice 2-4 (Follow the same structure as Practice 1, creating different mini-games using vectors and lists)

Here are some game ideas to spark your creativity:

* **Practice 2:** Word Jumble - Unscramble a jumbled word using a vector of characters.
* **Practice 3:** Shopping List Manager - Store and manage shopping items using a list data structure.
* **Practice 4:** Number Memory Game - Challenge the user to remember a sequence of randomly generated numbers stored in a vector.

## Challenge:

Create your own mini-game using C++ vectors or lists! Experiment with different functionalities and user interactions.  This is your chance to showcase your newfound skills!
